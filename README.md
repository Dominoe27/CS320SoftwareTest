## How do I ensure my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To keep my code functional, I focus on writing solid unit tests that cover both common scenarios and edge cases. I make sure each method behaves the way it should and that error handling works correctly. For security, I follow safe coding practices such as validating inputs, avoiding hardcoded sensitive data, and being intentional with exception handling to prevent leaking information. Regular code reviews and tools like static analyzers or dependency checkers also help maintain both functionality and security.

## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I start by analyzing the requirements and looking at the problem from the user’s perspective. I think about what they’re trying to accomplish, how they’ll interact with the program, and where they might run into issues. If something is unclear, I ask questions to get more context. Throughout development, I prioritize usability and make sure the program is intuitive, reliable, and actually solves the intended problem.

## How do I approach designing software?

I begin by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable pieces. From there, I design classes and methods with clear responsibilities to keep the structure clean and maintainable. I consider how different components interact and try to minimize unnecessary dependencies. Testing is part of the design process from the beginning. I build validation and testing strategies into the structure so issues can be caught early, making the final product more stable and easier to evolve.

## Project Overview

This project was originally created in **CS-320: Software Testing and Automation**. It focuses on managing contact data using a service-layer design and enforces validation rules through the Contact class. The artifact has been enhanced to strengthen modularity, improve exception handling, and increase maintainability for use in my CS-499 ePortfolio.

## Enhancements Summary

- Improved error handling with clear, intentional exceptions
- Centralized validation logic for cleaner and reusable methods
- Added helper methods to reduce duplication in the service layer
- Updated unit tests to reflect improved behavior and predictability
- Improved consistency, readability, and maintainability across the codebase
